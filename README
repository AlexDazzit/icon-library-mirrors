Summary
=======

The icon-library-mirrors repository is for free and open source or public domain icon and user interface libraries.

So far it includes the tango icon theme set (public domain) and the tigris style library (Apache license).

The docunext-webapp-icons are a subset of the libraries that I have selected and categorized as potentially being useful for web applications.
